# Fizz

A (very-much WIP) Rust-based physics simulation library. A successor to my previous [fluid simulation](https://github.com/ritobanrc/fluid_simulator) that's hopefully more organized and consistent.

# Acknowledgements
Much of the design of this library is heavily inspired by [PhysBAM](https://physbam.stanford.edu/), and in particular, the fork of it maintained by [Prof. Craig Schroeder](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~craigs/research.html) at the University of California, Riverside.
